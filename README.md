# Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Natural Language Processing Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various natural language processing topics.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. The starting code is available here, as well as each project solution.

## Content

### Introduction to Natural Language Processing

* [Text Processing](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/text-processing): Learn to prepare text obtained from different sources for further processing, by cleaning, normalizing and splitting it into individual words or tokens.
* [Spam Classifier with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/spam-classifier): Learn how to build a spam e-mail classifier using the naive Bayes algorithm.
* [IBM Watson Bookworm Lab](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/bookworm): Learn how to build a simple question-answering agent using IBM Watson.
* **[Project]** [Part-of-Speech Tagging](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/project-hmm-tagger): Implement a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset.

### Computing with Natural Language

* [Topic Modeling](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/topic-modeling): Learn to split a collection of documents into topics using Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA). In the lab, you'll be able to apply this model to a dataset of news articles.
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/sentiment-analysis): Learn about using several machine learning classifiers, including Recurrent Neural Networks, to predict the sentiment in text. Apply this to a dataset of movie reviews.
* [Deep Learning Attention](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/attention): Attention is one of the most important recent innovations in deep learning. In this section, you'll learn attention, and you'll go over a basic implementation of it in the lab.
* [RNN Keras Lab](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/rnn-keras-lab): Prepare for the Machine Translation project by getting hands-on practice with RNNs in Keras.
* **[Project]** [Machine Translation](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/project-machine-translation): Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

### Communicating with Natural Language

* **[Project]** [DNN Speech Recognizer](https://github.com/naderabdalghani/udacity-natural-language-processing-nanodegree/tree/master/project-dnn-speech-recognizer): Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition pipeline.
